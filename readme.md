# Learn Stack

Not just any simple flashcard app.

## Description

A React Native mobile app that improves vocabulary retention through a mix of multiple-choice and written questions. The app adapts based on the user's performance, offering a personalized learning experience that improves recall and understanding of vocabulary.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node.js v22.2.0+ (older versions have not been tested)
- A functioning human brain or AI bot.

### Installing

- Clone the repo
- cd into learn-stack (where the .gitignore file is)
- type 'npm install' into your terminal

  Ensure you have the following VSCode extensions:

  - Tailwind CSS Intellisense extension
  - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets extension
  - GitHub Copilot (very helpful for generating TypeScript types)

- Type the following into terminal:

```
npx expo start -c
```

The npx expo start -c runs and clears the cache, which is good to know, but in the future, you can usually just get by launching with:

```
npm start
```

- Download Expo Go on GooglePlay/App Store

### Executing program

- Make sure both your mobile device and computer are on the same network.

- Android:

  - Open Expo Go app and tap 'Scan QR code', then scan the QR code in your computer's terminal. You may have to scroll up to see it.

- iOS:

  - Go to 'Expo Go' in the Settings app turn on 'Local Network'
  - Turn VPN status off (Not Connected)
    Scan the QR code in the terminal via your phone's camera app (you may have to scroll up to see it).

- If you see a message that tailwindcss is taking a long time to build, make sure that there are NO SPACES or any special characters in the filepath from your root drive to your project directory. If there are, you may need to consider a different directory for this project.

- The app should launch. You're done. :)
